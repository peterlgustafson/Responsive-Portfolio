      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/peter.png" class="auth-image" alt="Peter's Photo">

      <p>Born and raised in Chicago. After studying Economics and International Affairs at George Mason University in the Washington, DC area I moved to Seattle and worked at 2 early stage SAAS startups which have both been recently acquired. 
        I started in Customer Support and worked my way up into Account Management, Sales Engineering and Business Development roles. </p> 
        <p> After 3 years in Seattle I moved back to Chicago and worked for Trading Technologies in a Customer Success 
        Operations role helping them build out process and systems to migrate their existing client base onto their new cloud based platform. In January 2018 I resigned by position and started a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at Northwestern University. 
        I am excited to learn how to code and take the next step in my career!</p>
